# Bella Pizzeria Electronic Pizza Time Logs

I made this app for Bella Pizzeria in 2016 using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (jQuery), and Apache Cordova to compile it into an Android APK which is then published to the Amazon App Store.

It is intended to be installed and used on the Amazon Fire 10 tablet.

## Background
Hot and cold holding temperatures limit the growth of organisms that cause food borne illnesses in potentially hazardous foods. When using time as a public health control, the food must be discarded within four hours from the point in time when food is removed from temperature control.

This app enables managers to easily keep the mandatory time control logs as required by the public health department, and automatically alerts staff when food needs to be discarded.
